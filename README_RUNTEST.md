# Add foundry test setup 

This version of code demonstrates a temporary setup to test smart contracts that depend on ZetaChain's toolkit.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

Due to incompatibilities between the **latest version** of `@zetachain/protocol-contracts` and the current examples/standard contracts, we are using version `13.0.0` of the protocol contracts **instead of the latest release**.

Additionally, as mentioned previously, this is a **temporary workaround** while waiting for `FoundrySetup.t.sol` to be merged into the main [`@zetachain/toolkit`](https://github.com/zeta-chain/toolkit) repository.

Therefore, the following dependencies are **temporary** and **should not be considered part of the final version** of the `toolkit` repo.
